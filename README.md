Matrix-style screens in Applesoft

README

December 23, 2024

Matrix is a screen generato, coded in AppleSoft for use in emulators like AppleWin or on original hardware, in the style of the screens from the Matrix movies.

I scoured Google for something like this, and nothing turned up so decided to make Matrix. Then, after long hours of work, I looked again, and this turned up: https://github.com/neilk/apple-ii-matrix/

I admit to being a little disappointed at first, I was feeling quite proud that I was creating something that wasn't readily available in AppleSoft and then this turned up.

As it turns out, as is usually the case, it's better to have more than one viewpoint on things, and this is no exception. I encourage you to load Neil's efforts up on your AppleSoft platform of choice and check it out. I admit to being a bit biased towards my own efforts, but I do like how he has three strings of code generating sequentially so it looks like a letter from string a,b,c and then over again. It gives the screen the appearance of more activity, and if I find some time I may test this in my own project.

In any event, feel free to copy and paste my listing (MATRIX.txt) into AppleWin and save as a file, then run it for yourself. Use this anyway you like, let me know what you make with it :)

Thanks!
